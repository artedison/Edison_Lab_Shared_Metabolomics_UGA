## RTExtract: Time-series NMR spectra quantifi-cation based on 3D surface ridge tracking 
This provide function and workflow for compound quantification by ridge tracking in CIVM (Continuous in vivo Metabolism by NMR) data set. The method relate paper is currentl ubder review.

The folder ./ridgetracing_newmeth contains related functions and ./ridgetracing_paper_workflow contains related workflows.

To run the workflow, you need you can git the [Metabolomics toolbox](https://github.com/artedison/Edison_Lab_Shared_Metabolomics_UGA) and add it to MATLAB path
