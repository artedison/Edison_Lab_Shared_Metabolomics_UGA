%% processCIVMdata(studyInfo,varargin)
% 
%     This function provides an interactive way to process single or CIVM datasets 
%     A CIVM dataset is defined as a time series run collected on a distinct sample, 
%     Examples of a sample include the following standard CIVM controls:
%         - Culture Media (~10 sequential spectra)
%         - Culture Media + Spike-in carbon source  (~10 sequential spectra)
%         - Culture Media + Organism (~1 h of sequential spectra, 100's of spectra)
%     as well as the "actual" run:
%         - Culture Media + Organism + Spiked carbon source (hours of collection, 1000's of spectra)
%     
%     When a dataset is recorded in TopSpin (via iconNMR or multizg, etc.), the 
%     spectra are recorded under a uniquely named directory. For instance:
%         "civm_ncrassa_qax_03_media"     
%             
%     For the experiment structure listed above, the directories would be:
%         civm_ncrassa_qax_03_media
%         civm_ncrassa_qax_03_media_org
%         civm_ncrassa_qax_03_media_qa
%         civm_ncrassa_qax_03_media_org_qa_iconRun
%
%     These will all be kept under civm_ncrassa_qax_03, which is the name
%     of this overall experiment.
%
%     Individual spectrum directories are contained under each "sample directory"
%     or dataset. One of these files, i.e. "Bruker Files", for timepoint 1 
%     would look like this:
% 
%             1
%                 acqu
%                 acqus
%                 ...
%                 pdata
%                     1
%                         1i
%                         1r
%                         ...
%                         title
%                 ...
%                 vtc_pid_settings 
% 
%     Each dataset typically has a different chemical composition, and therefore
%     must be processed uniquely. Further, datasets often contain different 
%     experiment types (producing different data), e.g. NOESYPR1D or HSQCETGPSISP.
%     These typically require different processing schemes as well. In this 
%     workflow, I separate these data early on under the sample's directory 
%     structure. Each sample (s) thus contains one or more expTypes (t), where
%     sample(s).expType(t) indexes a "specList". A specList is a continuous 
%     time series on a single sample with made up of only one data type. In 
%     other words, a specList is the largest group of spectra that can be
%     processed as together in a meaningful way. 
%     
%     The primary steps that we typically take to converting these Bruker 
%     files to MATLAB-readable data are:
%         
%         1) Getting the data off the magnet and onto our local machine/Dropbox
%             In my hands, this is best done by compressing the datasets into
%             a zip/tar file on the magnet, then uploading to Dropbox. 
%         2) Unpacking the data and making sure it's organized and TRACEABLE back
%             to the magnet's data storage/backups
%             I put the zip/tar file in the appropriate project directory, and 
%             make a 
%         3) Re-organizing the data into a directory structure that suits analysis
%             goals and reproducibility standards
%         4) Pre-processing the data using nmrPipe (there are several reasons 
%             we use this software over others, including:
%                 - the software is open-source,maintained by NIST, and ubiquitous
%                 - the software is wildly flexible, and offers hundreds of options
%                 - quality of output is typically superior in our hands
%             	- easy to call from/interface with other pipelines
%         5) Loading the data into a MATLAB workflow pipeline
%             NOTE: at this point, data from related datasets may be combined
%         6) Processing the data within MATLAB using Edison Lab Metabolomics Toolbox
%             (https://github.com/artedison/Edison_Lab_Shared_Metabolomics_UGA)
%         7) Visualizing the dataset (often in ways that would make a cool 
%             T-shirt or album cover)
%         8) Extracting quantifiable features from the dataset. 
%         
%     This function covers steps 2-4. It first divides up the data and 
%     organizes it into specLists sampele(s).expType(t) under a studyInfo 
%     structure. It builds out the standard directory structure, moves the 
%     data accordingly (to eliminate human errors/save TONS of time), and then
%     pre-processes the data in an interactive way. 
%     
%       Specifically, for each spectrum in each specList, we need to:
%           - produce the fid.com file
%           - run the fid.com file to produce an .fid file
%           - produce an ft.com file
%           - run the ft.com file to produce an .ft file
%           - Visualize at least one spectrum using nmrDraw to assess 
%             p0 and p1 phasing, and potentially baseline, solvent suppression, 
%             and line broadening issues
%           - Apply these corrections to all spectra in the current specList,
%             and reprocess them.
%           - Check the spectra again in nmrDraw to verify that artifacts have
%             been removed and no more have been introduced. 
% 
%     The next step is to pass the studyInfo to an .m file generation script 
%     which will produce a basic MATLAB processing pipeline that results in 
%     visualized CIVM data for each specList. Finally, the data should be 
%     combined and extracted.
