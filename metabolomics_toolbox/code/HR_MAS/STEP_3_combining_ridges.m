%% STEP 3: Combining Ridges

% Notes:
    % It seems best to not calculate mean and SD across samples if
    % their timepoints aren't the same. Maybe we can do this in a 2D way,
    % but that conflates P0 and biological error.

    % It seems best to sum all ridges annotated as a given compound within
    % a sample, as these truly have the same timepoints and this will
    % reduce the effect of noise and baseline. With this, each compound
    % needs to be reported with the number of ridges used to quantify it.
    % The caveat here is that the ridges are all different lengths. As
    % such, summing is not really possible, and statistics such as the
    % number of ridges per compound are not entirely helpful.

    % The Adjusted.ExtendedIntensities field should not be used, as it is
    % complicated to access. Instead, these data (and more) are now also
    % stored in Samples.adjustedRidges.

% load('ridges.mat')
Samples=Samples2;
samples=[1,2,3,7,8,9]; % maps j to correct index in sampleData

%% 2. Adjust the time vectors according to inoculation-start time lag
% Sample #, time lag (days), sampleData index
lags = [4   0.013194444 1
        5   0.011805556 2
        6   0.011805556 3
        10  0.018055556 7
        11  0.01875 8
        12  0.015277778 9];
lags(:,2)=lags(:,2)*24; % convert days to hours

% For each sample correct time
for s=1:length(Samples)
    for r=find(~cellfun(@isempty,{Samples(s).adjustedRidges.LinearInds})) % only loop through actual ridges
        Samples(s).adjustedRidges(r).Times=Samples(s).adjustedRidges(r).Times+lags(s,2);
    end
end

%% 3. Set up the ridge-compound peaks map. Assign each ridge a name and compound.
sampleKey={'aerobic','aerobic','aerobic','anaerobic','anaerobic','anaerobic'};
ridgeNames={'unknown-179','valine 1' 'valine 2' 'valine 3' 'valine 4' 'isoleucine 1' 'isoleucine 2' 'alanine 1' 'alanine 2' 'lactate 1' 'lactate 2' 'arginine 1' 'arginine 2' 'arginine 3' 'arginine 4' 'arginine 5' 'arginine 6' 'arginine 7' 'arginine 8' 'uracil 1' 'uracil 2' 'glucose-1-phosphate 1' 'glucose-1-phosphate 2' 'glucose-1-phosphate 3' 'glucose-1-phosphate 4' 'adenosine 3' 'adenosine 4' 'tyrosine 1' 'tyrosine 2' 'phenylalanine 1' 'phenylalanine 2' 'uridine 1' 'uridine 2' 'choline' 'trehalose 1' 'trehalose 2' 'guanosine' 'citrate 1' 'citrate 2' 'citrate 3' 'citrate 4' 'succinate' 'glutamate' 'fumarate' 'formate' 'glucose 1' 'glucose 2'  'glucose 3' 'glucose 4'  'glucose 5' 'glucose 6' 'glucose 7' 'glucose 8' 'ethanol 1' 'ethanol 2' 'ethanol 3' 'ethanol 4' 'ethanol 5' 'ethanol 6' 'ethanol 7' };

annotations=regexprep(ridgeNames,'( )\d',''); % get rid of the peak number for compounds with multiple peaks
compoundList=unique(annotations); % how many/which compounds have we quantified?

% numberOfProtons=repmat(1,1,length(annotations));  % this is a dummy vector for number of protons represented by each peak (this is actually not applied here)

ridgeNames=[ridgeNames,num2cell(unknowns)];

for j=1:length(Samples)

        Samples(j).adjustedRidges(i).RidgeName = ridgeNames{i};
        Samples(j).adjustedRidges(i).Annotation = annotations{i};
    end
end

%% Sum all ridges (normalized to #protons) for each compound (excluding unknowns)
[compounds]=combineRidges(Samples,compoundList,samples,sampleKey);

%% Add plot colors to the structure
% Make the colors
%uisetcolor() % Used this to get the desired colors
blue=[0,.3,1];
yellow=[1    0.7490    0.0510];%

% Add to the compounds structure
