%     return an array as well as a matrix tabulating what info is in which
%     axis.  Note that the dimension order of NMR pipe format spectra is
%     w4 w3 w2 w1 = dims # 1, 2, 3, 4.  The donor dims (i.e. the dims to be
%     subsumed by covariance) can be optionally input as a vector, e.g.
%     [1 3 4].  If the donor dims are not indicated, the first N/2 dims of
%     the input N-D spectrum are considered acceptor dims and the remaining
%     dims are considered donor dims to be covaried.
