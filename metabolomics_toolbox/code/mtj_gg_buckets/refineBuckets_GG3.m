%   Description:  
%
%           refineBuckets()  is a tool to assist users with refining buckets drawn by opt_bucket
% 
%           (Reference:  	SAA Sousa, A MagalhÃ£es, MMC Ferreira, Optimized Bucketing for NMR spectra: Three
%           				case studies. Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 122, 93-102 (2013).)
% 					 
%           and modified by functions in the Edison Lab Metabolomics Toolbox.
% 
%           You will usually run this function after optimizing opt_bucket parameters, generating the buckets, and 
%           filtering to include only those buckets which include peaks (per Peakpick1d on each spectrum).
%           Once running, you can zoom around the spectrum and check out your buckets, which are highlighted.
%           When you find a region you want to modify, use key commands to
%           switch modes.
%
%           Key commands include: 
% 
%               'a'- add new bucket 
%               'r'- select buckets to remove
%               'c'- select buckets to combine
%               'e'- select buckets to expand/redraw
%               'h'- help
%               'q'- quit/finish refinement
% 
% Inputs: 
%
%         - matrix		'X' matrix, spectral matrix
%         - ppm			ppm value vector corresponding to matrix
%         - optOB_out 	output structure from opt_bucketing pipeline: (optimize_optBucket -> filterBuckets_Peaks_opt)
%
%         Optional (name-value pairs):
%             'expandedBuckets'   (usual case) using the valley-expanded buckets rather than traditional buckets 
%             'previousFigure'    use buckets refined from previous figure
%                                 as a starting point. Buckets from the figure
%                                 will be used, but data come from
%                                 optOB_out input
%             'figID'             If figID is provided, extractROIs will determine if it's
%                                 a figure filename or figure handle and act accordingly.
%                                 If not provided, it will default to empty, in which case gcf
%                                 will be used.
%
% 
% Outputs:
%
%         - bucketStruct		(adds refineBuckets to the optOB_out struct)
%             - refineBuckets contains:
%                 - originalBuckets: 	original bins (ppm bounds) provided (derived from optOB_out.results.binsWithPeaks)
%                 - refinedBuckets: 	updated bucket list (ppm bounds) after refining
%                 - removedBuckets: 	bucket (ppm bounds) which were removed during refinement
%                 - addedBuckets:       buckets (ppm bounds) which were added during refinement
%                 - figure:             name of the output figure (saved automatically in cd())
%             - bins_refined_ figure:   the figure is saved. You can use a function
%                                       like gatherROIsFromFigures() to get features from the figure
